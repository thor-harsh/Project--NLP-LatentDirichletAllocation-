# Project--NLP-LatentDirichletAllocation-

<table>
  
**In this project we'll be grouping different articles from npr.csv file on various topics using LDA(LatentDirichletAllocation) in Natural Language Processing.** <br></br>

We will perform three tasks to perform the final grouping of different reviews on topics:<br></br>

1: We will grab vocabulary of words <br>
2: Grabbing the topic<br>
3: Grabbing the words with highest probability for a given topic<br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand LDA(Latent Dirichlet Allocation), and NLP(Natural Language Processing) First**...<br></br>


**What is LDA?** <br></br>

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a popular statistical model used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for topic modeling, a process that automatically identifies topics present in a text corpus.<br></br>

**What is (NLP)Natural Language Processing**?<br></br>

NLP or Natural language processing is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and linguistics. It is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language.<br></br>

NLP combines computational linguistics‚Äîrule-based modeling of human language‚Äîwith statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer‚Äôs intent and sentiment.<br></br>

NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly‚Äîeven in real time. There‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôve interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences. But NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.<br></br>


**Important Note: Go through the npr.rar file and extract the .csv file and get a proper understanding of it before jumping to the code.**

**So what are you waiting for...? Jump to the code to get started. As usual for any doubt or query see you in pull request section üòÅüòÇ. Thanks!**
